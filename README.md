<h1> Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard <br> (JavaScript / Plotly Demonstration) </h1>

#### Overview:
This project utilizes JavaScript and the Plotly library along with HTML and Bootstrap to create an interactive website dashboard to 
visualize how many microbes inhabit human navels. The data that is used by the program is contained in a JSON file provided courtesy of
<a href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity"> The Belly Button Biodiversity Project </a>.  The dashboard allows the 
user to select an individual test subject from a drop-down list which will automatically update the information displayed in their
browser.  The dashboard displays demographics about the test subject, which microbial species were found in their navels (and the amounts
present), and how frequently the subject cleans their belly buttons per week.

To run the program, click on the deployed website link below. <br>
